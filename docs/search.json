    "text": "1 Introduction\nMilitary spending reveals how nations perceive threats and prioritize security. We chose this topic because defense expenditure provides a quantitative lens into shifting global power dynamics and geopolitical competition. Our analysis explores three questions: How does military spending relate to national wealth? What spending patterns emerge among regional rivals such as India–Pakistan and Saudi Arabia–Iran? And how do major conflicts influence defense budgets even in distant states? Using the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database (1949–2024) and Arms Transfers Database (1950–present), we examine the connections between spending, economic capacity, regional competition, and global conflict. Understanding these patterns offers insight into how states allocate power, respond to perceived threats, and shape the broader architecture of international security.\nDescription of each data set for Shubham’s reference:\nrq1_wealth_spending: Country–year panel (1960–2024) focused on the relationship between military burden and economic development. Each row is a country–year with ISO3 code, UN region / subregion / custom region, military spending as a share of GDP (SIPRI, World Bank, and a merged “best available” spending_pct_gdp), SIPRI military spending in constant 2023 US dollars, and World Bank GDP per capita in current US dollars (gdp_per_capita_usd). This is the main dataset for RQ1 scatterplots (GDP per capita vs %GDP on defense), time series of top spenders, and regional comparison graphs.\nrq2_arms_races: Country–year panel (1960–2024) focused on military spending and arms imports. Each row is a country–year with ISO3 code, regional classifications, SIPRI military spending as % of GDP (spending_pct_gdp_sipri), SIPRI constant-dollar military spending, and SIPRI arms imports in trend-indicator values (arms_imports_tiv) from the “top importers” arms-transfer file. This is the dataset you’ll use for rival‑pair time series (India–Pakistan, Saudi–Iran, etc.), regional “arms race” comparisons, and for linking spending trends with arms-import intensity.\nrq3_conflicts: Country–year panel (1960–2024) designed as a flexible event‑study dataset for global conflicts. It includes the same identifiers and regional variables as above plus both SIPRI and World Bank measures of spending as % of GDP (and a merged spending_pct_gdp), SIPRI constant-dollar spending, and arms imports. It’s intended as the all‑purpose panel for shock/event analyses (e.g. before/after 9/11, the Arab Spring, or the 2014/2022 Ukraine escalations) where you may want to subset by region (e.g. Europe, MENA) or by specific countries and look at level and composition of military effort around key dates.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project draws on two main data sources: the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) and SIPRI’s military expenditure and arms transfers databases. The WDI series on military expenditure as a share of GDP (MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS) and GDP per capita (NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) are compiled annually from national statistical offices, ministries of finance/defense, and international organizations, provided as CSV files with countries as rows and years as columns (1960–2024). SIPRI’s military expenditure database (SIPRI-Milex-data-1949-2024.xlsx) is compiled by researchers who harmonize official budget documents, defense reports, and NATO/UN sources to produce consistent series in constant 2023 USD and as percentage of GDP, updated annually in wide Excel format (1949–2024). The SIPRI Arms Transfers Database provides bilateral transfer values in millions of SIPRI TIVs by exporter/recipient/year. Key issues include missing coverage for low-income or conflict-affected states, country naming inconsistencies requiring ISO3 code harmonization, aggregate regions in WDI that must be removed, and occasional historical revisions that make results version-specific to the December 2024 download date.",

The nearly flat trend line confirms that a country’s GDP per capita has little bearing on its defense burden. Instead, regional clustering dominates — Middle Eastern countries (yellow) sit high regardless of wealth, while European nations (pink) cluster low. Notable outliers tell the real story:\nUkraine is absent from this graph — at 37% of GDP, its wartime spending would distort the entire scale. This single datapoint illustrates how existential threats override economic considerations entirely. Algeria and Morocco represent North Africa’s quiet arms race. Algeria, flush with hydrocarbon revenues, allocated 21% of all government expenditure to defense in 2024 — the highest share of any African nation. Morocco, despite two years of decline, increased spending by 2.6% in 2024. Together they account for 90% of North African military spending. Saudi Arabia and Russia both spend 6-7% despite vastly different wealth levels ($30K vs $12K GDP per capita), driven by regional power ambitions rather than economic capacity. Japan, Germany, and Ireland — all wealthy democracies — cluster below 2%, reflecting post-WWII constraints, alliance reliance, or neutrality.\nThe NATO 2% benchmark (dashed line) highlights a policy reality: many European allies now face pressure to meet this target, shifting from “aspirational” to “minimum” after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\nSource : https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2025-04/2504_fs_milex_2024.pdf\n\n\n3.1.2 Top Military Spenders Over Time\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Assuming data is already loaded as per your previous code\n# rq1_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/clean/rq1_wealth_spending.csv\")\n\n\n\nhighlight_countries &lt;- c(\n  \"United States of America\", \"China\", \"Russia\", \"India\", \"Ukraine\",\n  \"Saudi Arabia\", \"Germany\", \"Japan\"\n)\n\nrank_data &lt;- rq1_data |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 1990, !is.na(spending_constant_usd_sipri)) |&gt;\n  distinct(country, year, .keep_all = TRUE) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(rank = min_rank(-spending_constant_usd_sipri)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  filter(country %in% highlight_countries)\n\n# End labels for the right side of the chart\nend_labels &lt;- rank_data |&gt;\n  filter(year == max(year))\n\n# Key events (Positions adjusted slightly for visibility)\nevents &lt;- tribble(\n  ~year, ~label, ~y_pos,\n  1991, \"USSR\\nCollapse\", 12,\n  2001, \"9/11\", 12,\n  2014, \"Crimea\", 12,\n  2022, \"Ukraine\\nInvasion\", 12\n)\n\n\n# Create annotated bump chart\n\n\nggplot(rank_data, aes(x = year, y = rank, color = country, group = country)) +\n  # --- Event Markers (Vertical Lines) ---\n  geom_vline(\n    xintercept = c(1991, 2001, 2014, 2022),\n    linetype = \"dotted\",\n    color = \"grey60\",\n    linewidth = 0.5\n  ) +\n  # --- Event Labels ---\n  geom_text(\n    data = events,\n    aes(x = year, y = y_pos, label = label),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    size = 3,           # Slightly larger for readability\n    color = \"grey40\",\n    vjust = 1,\n    lineheight = 0.9    # Tighter line spacing for multi-line labels\n  ) +\n  # --- Main Bump Lines and Points ---\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.4, alpha = 0.9) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  # --- Direct Labels (Right side) ---\n  geom_text(\n    data = end_labels,\n    aes(x = year + 0.8, label = country),\n    hjust = 0,\n    size = 3.5,\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  # --- Scales ---\n  scale_y_reverse(\n    # FIX: Added '1' to breaks and changed limit to 0.5 to show Rank #1\n    breaks = c(1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12), \n    limits = c(13.5, 0.5) \n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(1990, 2024, by = 5),\n    limits = c(1990, 2031) # Extra space for text labels\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"United States of America\"= \"#2166AC\",\n      \"China\" = \"#E63946\",\n      \"Russia\" = \"#F4A261\",\n      \"India\" = \"#2A9D8F\",\n      \"Saudi Arabia\" = \"#9B5DE5\",\n      \"Germany\" = \"#457B9D\",\n      \"Japan\" = \"#E07A5F\",\n      \"Ukraine\" = \"#F2CC8F\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  # --- Labels and Theme ---\n  labs(\n    title = \"Global Military Spending Rankings (1990-2024)\",\n    subtitle = \"Major geopolitical shifts marked by key historical events\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Global Rank\",\n    caption = \"Source: SIPRI Military Expenditure Database\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey40\", size = 11),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation The bump chart reveals three decades of shifting military power.

The result exposes fundamental asymmetries: Ukraine sits alone in the upper-left — poor (~$5K GDP/capita) but allocating an extraordinary 37% of GDP to defense. Its medium-sized bubble reveals the limits of burden: even at wartime sacrifice levels, absolute spending remains constrained by economic size.\nChina’s massive bubble dominates despite sitting at just ~2% burden — wealth enables military power without economic strain. Compare to Pakistan: similar burden (~3%) but a tiny bubble because the underlying economy is far smaller.\nSaudi Arabia and Israel — both wealthy AND high-burden — occupy the upper-right quadrant. These are countries that can afford to sacrifice heavily.\nThe NATO cluster (Germany, France, UK) shows moderate wealth, low burden (~2%), but substantial bubbles — collective alliance spending substitutes for individual sacrifice.\nRussia’s bubble is larger than its GDP/capita (~$12K) would suggest because 7% burden on a large economy still generates significant absolute spending. Key insight: Burden measures sacrifice; bubble size measures actual military capacity. Pakistan sacrifices more than China (higher % GDP) but has far less military power.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# 1.

Three conflicts are marked:\nAugust War (2008): Both countries began steady increases afterward April War (2016): A brief spike, especially for Azerbaijan 44-Day War (2020): The decisive conflict — Azerbaijan’s years of investment paid off\nKey patterns:\n1995-2005: Azerbaijan consistently spent more (4% vs 2-3%), funded by emerging oil revenues 2005-2010: Convergence — both countries ramped up, lines cross around 2008 2010-2020: Parallel increases, with Azerbaijan maintaining a slight edge Post-2020: Armenia increased spending AFTER defeat, while Azerbaijan stabilized — the loser is now scrambling to rebuild\nThe underlying asymmetry: Azerbaijan’s oil wealth allowed sustained investment; Armenia, lacking natural resources, could only match this through higher economic sacrifice. The 2020 war outcome reflects this imbalance.\n\n3.3.1 India vs. Pakistan\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n# 1.

This 54-year view reveals a fundamental asymmetry: Pakistan’s arc:\nPeaked at ~7% during the 1980s (Soviet-Afghan war, US military aid) “Insurgency Begins” (late 1980s) marks the start of internal conflict burden Second peak around 2001 (“Insurgency Peak”) — post-9/11, Taliban spillover Gradual decline since, now at ~2.7%\nIndia’s steady decline:\nStarted around 3.5% in 1970 Brief spike after 1971 war Steady downward trend as economy grew faster than military spending Now at ~2.4% — the lowest in this 54-year period\nKey events marked:\n1971 War: Brief spike for both, previous years military modernisation data is not present. Expected that India spending must have gone up after 1962 war with China. And India Soviet Strategic Partnership for depfence. Kargil War (1999): Barely visible — too short to affect annual spending data Balakot Airstrike (2019): No significant spending change — symbolic rather than sustained\nThe convergence story: Both countries have reduced burden over time as GDP growth outpaced military spending growth. The gap has narrowed from ~4 percentage points (1980s) to less than 1 point today.\n\n\n3.3.2 Saudi Arabia vs. Iran\n\n\nCode\nsaudi_iran &lt;- rq2_data |&gt;\n  filter(country %in% c(\"Saudi Arabia\", \"Iran\"), year &gt;= 1970) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(spending_pct_gdp_sipri)) |&gt;\n  mutate(spending_pct = spending_pct_gdp_sipri * 100) |&gt;\n  distinct(country, year, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\nggplot(saudi_iran, aes(x = year, y = spending_pct, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(1979, 1990, 2011, 2015), \n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey50\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1979, y = 22, label = \"Islamic Rev.\", size = 2.8) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1990, y = 22, label = \"Gulf War\", size = 2.8) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2011, y = 22, label = \"Arab Spring\", size = 2.8) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2015, y = 22, label = \"Yemen\", size = 2.8) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale = 1, suffix = \"%\"),\n                     breaks = seq(0, 25, by = 5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1970, 2024, by = 10)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Iran\" = \"#239F40\", \"Saudi Arabia\" = \"#006C35\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Saudi Arabia vs. Iran: Military Spending as % of GDP\",\n    subtitle = \"Volatile patterns reflect oil prices and regional conflicts\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Military Spending (% of GDP)\",\n    caption = \"Source: SIPRI Military Expenditure Database\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, color = \"grey40\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolatile patterns reflect oil prices and regional conflicts — but also a fundamental asymmetry. This is the most dramatic of the rivalry charts: Saudi Arabia’s rollercoaster:\n1970s: Low (~5%), then Islamic Revolution spike 1980s peak (~19%): Iran-Iraq War fears, oil boom funding Gulf War (1990): Another spike to ~14% Post-2000 decline: Gradual reduction as threat perception eased Arab Spring (2011) + Yemen (2015): Renewed increases Current (~7%): Still among the highest burdens globally\nIran’s constrained flatline:\nPre-revolution: Rising with oil wealth Islamic Revolution (1979): Peak at ~12% (war with Iraq imminent) Post-1990: Collapsed to ~2-3% and stayed there Sanctions effect: US economic sanctions have crippled Iran’s ability to fund military growth Current (~2%): Fraction of Saudi burden despite equal threat perception\nThe divergence: Saudi Arabia’s spending tracks oil prices and regional threats. Iran’s spending is constrained by sanctions and economic isolation — it cannot spend even if it wants to. This is why Saudi Arabia outspends Iran ~10:1 in absolute terms despite similar rhetoric.\n\n\n3.3.3 Multiple Rival Pairs Comparison\n\n\n3.3.4 Top Arms Importers\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(zoo)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# 1.

Near-zero imports for 20 years, then an explosion in 2022-2023. This is what wartime emergency procurement looks like — a shape no other country displays.\nPakistan’s recent surge (peak 2023): Interesting timing — increased imports coincide with India’s relative decline. The arms race continues through procurement, not just spending.\n\nThese six graphs collectively reveal that military rivalries follow predictable patterns, but outcomes depend on resources. Armenia-Azerbaijan and India-Pakistan both show classic arms race dynamics (strong lagged correlations), but Azerbaijan’s oil wealth and India’s economic growth created asymmetric outcomes. Saudi-Iran isn’t a true arms race — sanctions have crippled Iran’s ability to compete. And Ukraine’s 2022 transformation — from near-zero to record-breaking in every metric — shows what happens when existential war overrides all economic constraints.\n\n\n3.3.5 Arms Race Dynamics: Lagged Correlation Analysis\n\n\nCode\n# RQ2: Lagged Correlation Analysis - India vs Pakistan\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nrq2_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/clean/rq2_arms_races.csv\")\n\n\n# Data Preparation (using dplyr:: prefix to avoid conflicts)\n\n\nindia_data &lt;- rq2_data |&gt;\n  filter(country == \"India\", year &gt;= 1975) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(spending_pct_gdp_sipri)) |&gt;\n  distinct(year, .keep_all = TRUE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(year, india_spending = spending_pct_gdp_sipri) |&gt;\n  mutate(india_spending = india_spending * 100)\n\npakistan_data &lt;- rq2_data |&gt;\n  filter(country == \"Pakistan\", year &gt;= 1975) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(spending_pct_gdp_sipri)) |&gt;\n  distinct(year, .keep_all = TRUE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(year, pakistan_spending = spending_pct_gdp_sipri) |&gt;\n  mutate(pakistan_spending = pakistan_spending * 100)\n\nindia_pak_lag &lt;- india_data |&gt;\n  inner_join(pakistan_data, by = \"year\") |&gt;\n  arrange(year) |&gt;\n  mutate(india_lag1 = lag(india_spending, 1)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(india_lag1) & !is.na(pakistan_spending))\n\n# Calculate correlation\ncor_val &lt;- cor(india_pak_lag$india_lag1, india_pak_lag$pakistan_spending)\n\n\n# Create Plot\n\n\nggplot(india_pak_lag, aes(x = india_lag1, y = pakistan_spending)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = year), size = 3.5, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"grey30\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(name = \"Year\", option = \"plasma\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = \"%\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(suffix = \"%\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Arms Race Dynamics: India-Pakistan Lagged Relationship\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\n      \"Does India's spending predict Pakistan's next-year response?
