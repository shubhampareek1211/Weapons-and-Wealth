# Introduction
Military spending reveals how nations perceive threats and prioritize security. We chose this topic because defense expenditure provides a quantitative lens into shifting global power dynamics and geopolitical competition. Our analysis explores three questions: How does military spending relate to national wealth? What spending patterns emerge among regional rivals such as India–Pakistan and Saudi Arabia–Iran? And how do major conflicts influence defense budgets even in distant states? Using the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database (1949–2024) and Arms Transfers Database (1950–present), we examine the connections between spending, economic capacity, regional competition, and global  conflict. Understanding these patterns offers insight into how states allocate power, respond to perceived threats, and shape the broader architecture of international security.


Description of each data set for Shubham's reference: 

rq1_wealth_spending: Country–year panel (1960–2024) focused on the relationship between military burden and economic development. Each row is a country–year with ISO3 code, UN region / subregion / custom region, military spending as a share of GDP (SIPRI, World Bank, and a merged “best available” spending_pct_gdp), SIPRI military spending in constant 2023 US dollars, and World Bank GDP per capita in current US dollars (gdp_per_capita_usd). This is the main dataset for RQ1 scatterplots (GDP per capita vs %GDP on defense), time series of top spenders, and regional comparison graphs.

rq2_arms_races: Country–year panel (1960–2024) focused on military spending and arms imports. Each row is a country–year with ISO3 code, regional classifications, SIPRI military spending as % of GDP (spending_pct_gdp_sipri), SIPRI constant-dollar military spending, and SIPRI arms imports in trend-indicator values (arms_imports_tiv) from the “top importers” arms-transfer file. This is the dataset you’ll use for rival‑pair time series (India–Pakistan, Saudi–Iran, etc.), regional “arms race” comparisons, and for linking spending trends with arms-import intensity.

rq3_conflicts: Country–year panel (1960–2024) designed as a flexible event‑study dataset for global conflicts. It includes the same identifiers and regional variables as above plus both SIPRI and World Bank measures of spending as % of GDP (and a merged spending_pct_gdp), SIPRI constant-dollar spending, and arms imports. It’s intended as the all‑purpose panel for shock/event analyses (e.g. before/after 9/11, the Arab Spring, or the 2014/2022 Ukraine escalations) where you may want to subset by region (e.g. Europe, MENA) or by specific countries and look at level and composition of military effort around key dates.
